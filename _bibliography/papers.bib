  title={A deep learning model for online prediction of in-process dynamic characteristics of thin-walled complex blade machining},
 abstract={Online prediction of the dynamic characteristics of thin-walled workpieces, such as turbine blades, during the material removal process, plays an important role in the construction of digital twins systems for high-performance machining processes. However, the complex surfaces, thin-walled structures and time-varying characteristics of the blade machining process bring great challenges. The existing methods are either for simple structures or unadaptable to the continuous variation of the modal parameters, which cannot meet the requirements of online prediction for complex blade machining. To this end, this paper constructs a generative adversarial network with two output branches. By taking geometric information as input, online prediction of the modal parameters during the machining of complex thin-walled blades is realized. Considering the deviation between measured and predicted frequencies, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model is established to modify the frequency branch of the network, which enables the model to be adaptive to machining uncertainties. By integrating the proposed network into the self-developed computer-aided manufacturing software, a digital shadow system of modal parameters prediction during blade machining is constructed. The verification experiments show that the calculation time of the proposed model is 1.35 s. The results demonstrate that the above system can achieve high-performance online prediction of modal parameters in the thin-walled complex blade machining process.},

  title={An efficient surrogate model for prediction and control of stress relief distortion in large blade machining},
 abstract={Deformation during the machining of large turbine blades based on a forged blank is always inevitable and unpredictable because of the individual difference in residual stress of the blanks. Compensation and control of the machining deformation is of great challenge since nondestructive measurement and accurate modeling of the distributed residual stress of complex surfaces are unavailable. To this end, this paper constructs a novel data-driven model based on the U-Koopman neural operator, which is an improvement of the Koopman neural operator to describe the relationship between the deformation after the current cutting stage and that of the next cutting stage. To avoid expensive experiments and tests, the finite element method is utilized to simulate the continuous multi-step machining process of large blades, which contains residual stress generation during forging process and deformation generation during cutting process, and then construct the dataset for model training. Crossvalidation is implemented to verify the superior generalization ability of the proposed model over the benchmark models and the effectiveness of the related improvements of the model based U-Koopman neural operator. The results of case study show that the proposed model can predict and compensate for the deformation in-process and improve the machining accuracy and efficiency of large blades.},
